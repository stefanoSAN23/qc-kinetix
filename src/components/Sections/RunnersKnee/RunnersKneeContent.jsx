You might be dealing with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS or PFS), commonly known as "runner's knee," a condition that affects up to{' '}
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557657/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25% to 40% of all runners</a>.

          <h2 className="runners-knee-heading">Understanding Runner's Knee and Its Impact on Marathon Training</h2>

          <p>
            Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome is characterized by a dull, aching sensation around or behind your kneecap. For a marathon runner, these symptoms can be particularly frustrating, often appearing during or after a run and disrupting your training schedule.
          </p>

          <p>Common symptoms you might experience include:</p>

          <ul className="runners-knee-list">
            <li>Discomfort that worsens while running, squatting, or climbing stairs.</li>
            <li>Pain after sitting for long periods with your knees bent, like at a desk or in a car.</li>
            <li>A feeling of weakness or instability in the knee.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Runner's knee can be caused by several factors, including overuse from high-impact training, muscle imbalances in the hips and quadriceps, or improper running form. While traditional methods like rest, ice, and pain medications can provide temporary relief, they often just mask the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause.
          </p>

          <h2 className="runners-knee-heading">How Regenerative Sports Medicine Transforms Runner's Knee Treatment</h2>

          <p>
            What if you could address your knee discomfort without surgery or a long recovery period? That's the goal of regenerative sports medicine. Instead of masking symptoms, our approach uses natural biologics from your own body to support its inherent ability to revitalize itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            At QC Kinetix, our <a href="https://qckinetix.com/regenerative-medicine/prp-treatments/" data-type="link" data-id="https://qckinetix.com/regenerative-medicine/prp-treatments/">Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy</a> and <a href="https://qckinetix.com/regenerative-medicine/stem-cell-treatments/" data-type="link" data-id="https://qckinetix.com/regenerative-medicine/stem-cell-treatments/">stem cell treatment</a> focus on introducing these biologics to the affected area in your knee. This process can help reduce inflammation and improve the condition of damaged tissues. Unlike invasive surgery, these treatments are minimally invasive, require little to no downtime, and are designed to preserve the natural function and structure of your joint.
          </p>

          <h3 className="runners-knee-heading">The Science Behind Our PRP and Stem Cell Treatment</h3>

          <p>
            Our medical teams utilize different types of biologic therapies or treatments to create a customized plan for your specific needs. Two of the most common approaches include:
          </p>

          <ul className="runners-knee-list">
            <li>
              <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5444079/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Platelet-Rich Plasma</strong></a><strong> (PRP):</strong> This therapy begins with a blood draw. Your blood is then placed in a centrifuge to obtain a high concentration of platelets. These platelets contain growth factors that, when introduced to an area of discomfort, can help stimulate your body's natural healing processes and reduce inflammation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7247342/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Stem Cell Treatment</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This treatment uses biologics derived from your own bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). The components found in bone marrow are foundational to your body's ability to revitalize itself. When introduced into the knee joint, they can support tissue improvement and help reduce inflammation, working to enhance the condition of cartilage and strengthen surrounding structures.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Both of these approaches are designed to work in harmony with your body, promoting tissue revitalization from within.
